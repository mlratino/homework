// Create my array of animals

var animals=["zebra", "rhino", "giraffe", "owl", "dog", "cat"];

// console.log(animals[0]);
// console.log(animals[1]);
// console.log(animals[2]);
// console.log(animals[3]);

// // This counts the number of animals in the array. using animal.length makes 0 a starting point and makes us be able to loop the function
// var length = animals.length
// console.log(length);

// to be able add to the array or not know how many items use a for loop
    // for (var i=0; i<animals.length; i++) {}
// create a counter i for integer, start the i at 0 as long as that integer is less than that animals array do whatever is inside of the brackets. once you are done doing that I want you to increment and start over



// NOW!...

for (var i=0; i<animals.length; i++) {
console.log(animals[i]);
}
// this will create a loop until it ticks through all of the objects in the array until it finishes and loops to 0 and exits the array. This makes it possible to continuously add on to the array. where i is less than the total length of the array add the object and increment i until it reaches i< the total length of the array. This is useful because you don't have to hard code each new animal...object
