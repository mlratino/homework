<!-- I need the user to make a choice
Computer makes a choice
Capture those computerChoicesCompare those choices, and determine a win, loss, or tie
Display the result to the user -->

// Problem- How to capture variable...input
// 2.Get user input using keypress and lets go the function will execute and track it. store info as a variable for later use.

// Create variables to hold number of wins and losses and ties. They start at 0. We can't just declare it we have to initialize it with a variable

var wins = 0;
// // same as users score
var losses =0;
var ties =0;


//  var wins =0,
//      ties =0,
//      losses =0;


// solution:this function is run when user presses the key

document.onkeyup=function(event){
    // determine which key was pressed. Stor the event in the variable to be used later
    var userGuess = event.key;
    // key is a property of the object event

// 3. Problem: get random choice from the computer. Solution:  Creates an array that lists out all of the . Randomly make a choice from the array
// 3.  Creates an array that lists out all of the options



var computerChoices =["r","p","s"];

// Randomly choose from the options(array) Computer chooses. Math is a global object. random is a method that give a random number between 0 and . use computerChoices to define the length array indexing
//  math.floor is a tool it uses to choose from our array
var computerGuess =computerChoices[Math.floor(Math.random()*computerChoices.length)];

// 4. Problem: Compare guesses and determine result Solution: Use conditional statements in order to determine result
//  this logic determines the outcome of t he game(win loss tie) and increments the appropriate category

if((userGuess === "r")|| (userGuess === "p")||(userGuess ==="s")) {
//  equality operator check "translates the key stroke"  // 
// once the condition is met, do something with the result. Solution:Store the result in counter variables

if((userGuess === "r") && (computerGuess === "s")) {
    wins++;
} 
else if((userGuess === "r") && (computerGuess === "p")) {
    losses++;

// need to display output to hold our new HTML. Our HTML now keeps track of the user and computer guesses, and wins/losses/ties. intersperses results with the string to describe the data. Display data using a query selector
//  this will be rendered because of below
var html =
"<p> You chose: "  + userGuess + "</p>" +
"<p>Hal chose: " + computerGuess + "</p>" +

// set the inner HTML contents of the #game div to our html string..connect them?
// document.querySelector("#game").innerHTML =html;

// could have done this: Replace whatever is inside the HTML div with the var html
document.getElementById("game").innerHTML =html;

// it is the same thing query selector allows me to select anything and pass it
