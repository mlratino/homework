<!-- ### File

* [`sandwich-click-unsolved`](Unsolved/sandwich-click-unsolved.html)

### Instructions

* Add in the missing code such that clicking any of the sandwiches causes…

  1. An alert message to popup saying something snarky about the sandwich type.

  2. A second alert message that displays to the user how many of that specific sandwich they've eaten.

  3. **HINT:** You will need counter variables.

* **BONUS:** Add an image to the `image-div` on the click event. -->

    <!-- ID’s are unique
    Each element can have only one ID
    Each page can have only one element with that ID
    When I was first learning this stuff, I heard over and over that you should only use ID’s once, but you can use classes over and over. It basically went in one ear and out the other because it sounded more like a good “rule of thumb” to me rather than something extremely important. If you are purely an HTML/CSS person, this attitude can persist because to you, they really don’t seem to do anything different.
    
    Here is one: your code will not pass validation if you use the same ID on more than one element. Validation should be important to all of us, so that alone is a big one. We’ll go over more reasons for uniqueness as we go on. -->
